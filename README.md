This assignment is my attempt to recreate the line graph I drew by hand for our first class. The graph is an overview of Ebola cases in the three most affected countries in West Africa: Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Resource: The World Health Organization situation reports: http://apps.who.int/ebola/en/current-situation/ebola-situation-report Since the data is cumulative, I chose the last report of each available month in order to use each month as the "ticks" or "marker" points. I created an Excel spreadsheet with three columns: Date, Cases and Deaths to organize this information.

Question: Even though the data will live in data.js, what would be the best way to share external files if I needed to, say, for group projects (other than thumb drives/emails)?

Like my hand-drawn chart, my horizontal axis will be "Date," and my vertical axis will be "Incidences." I will be using the line chart example shown on https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart after 5 failed attempts at trying to code using class examples. I originally tried to manipulate the chart data we used in class but couldn't figure out why the lines weren't showing. I felt like I was close once -- the chart itself showed but the lines didn't.

I added markers for each data point, per chapter 4 of Dona Wong's book. I also added an outline around the chart.
